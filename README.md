# Machine-Learning-Models-Applied-to-IoT-Threat-Classification

Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, LabelEncoder, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree

Project Overview:
Conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of multiple machine learning models to classify IoT threats using a real-world dataset. The goal was to identify the most accurate and efficient algorithm for detecting cybersecurity threats in IoT networks.

Responsibilities & Contributions:
Performed data preprocessing and feature selection on a labeled IoT dataset using Python and Pandas.

Encoded categorical features using LabelEncoder and handled class imbalance through train_test_split.

Implemented and trained various ML models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree.

Evaluated models using metrics including accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve analysis.

Visualized results with Matplotlib, identifying Random Forest as the top-performing model with 99.91% accuracy.

Documented the complete workflow and contributed to the final academic report and presentation.

Outcome:
Achieved near-perfect accuracy with the Random Forest classifier and highlighted key trade-offs between performance and interpretability across models. Provided insights into applying ML for real-time IoT threat detection systems.
